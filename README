# jloomis@gmail.com - crappy modified facebook chat example with oauth 2.0
# Facebook's chat server doesn't accept ssl connections, hence no access token
# authentication. To get around that, we parse a session key out of the
# access token, and use an old facebook REST API method - auth.promoteSession -
# to associate a secret with it.
